# password_generator_project
That's my first project done in Python. Just training.

To use it you need Python 3.10 and CMD.
Open the password_generator.py file by CMD and follow the steps:
1) Type password length
2) Type password difficulty on the scale from 1 to 3
3) Decide countinue or not
4) Check your password(s) in the file

I will improve that code later on, also I wanna make some user-friendly interface for it, so it can be a real project.
