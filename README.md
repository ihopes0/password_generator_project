# password_generator_project
That's my first project done in Python. Just training.
This branch is an improved version of my first password generator.
Here I used Tkinter for creating a window with all that pass generating stuff in it.

To use it you need Python 3.10 and CMD.
Open the password_generator.py file by CMD and generate your password!
You can manage it's length and content(letters, numbers or characters).

 I really had a great experience writing it.
